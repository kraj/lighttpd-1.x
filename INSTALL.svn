Check out the source
------------
Review which source you want to checkout at:
http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/browser
http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/browser/tags

note the current lastest version is lighttpd-merge-1.4.x not trunk:
http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/browser/branches/lighttpd-merge-1.4.x

and check it out by ::

  svn co svn://svn.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/branches/lighttpd-merge-1.4.x


Build, Test and Install
------------

with autoconf
------------

  $ cd lighttpd-1.x.x
  $ ./autogen.sh
if you have problem with autogen.sh, check aclocal autoconf automake version

check configure options
  $ ./configure --help
  $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/lighttpd/ --enable-...
  $ make clean
  $ make check
  $ src/lighttpd -Df your_test.conf
  (Ctrl+C once or twice to terminate lighttpd)
  $ su -
  # make install
  # exit

with scons
------------
copy and modify config.py for your own needs with your favorite editor:
  $ cp config.py-sample config.py
  $ $EDITOR config.py

make sure your scons version is up to date, v0.96.91.D001 works. old version is known to have problem to build lighttpd.
  $ scons --version
  $ scons
  $ scons check
  $ src/lighttpd -Df your_test.conf
  (Ctrl+C once or twice to terminate lighttpd)

  $ su -
  # scons install
as scons make some file owned by root now, you have to do:
  # chown yourusername:yourgroup -R .
  # exit


take look at the configfile in ./doc/lighttpd.conf,
make your own copy of that file before modify it for your needs.

Keep up to date with lastest svn repo
------------
simply do:
  $ svn up
and follow the instructions in "Build and Install".

Do not make a non-released version on production server, you have been warned.
